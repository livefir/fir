# Plan for Fir UI Debugging Tool

## 1. Overview

This document outlines a plan to build a UI debugging tool for the `fir` framework.

The tool will have two main components:

1. **Static Mismatch Analysis**: A startup-time tool that analyzes route templates and Go code to find discrepancies between server-sent events and client-side listeners.
2. **Live Event Inspector**: A web-based dashboard that visualizes the flow of events and UI patches in real-time.

## 2. Guiding Principles

* **Maximize Code Reuse**: The debug tool must leverage the framework's existing components for routing, template parsing, and event handling. Logic should not be duplicated in the `internal/debug` package.
* **Improve Core Logging**: Enhance the built-in logging capabilities of the framework to provide detailed diagnostics when a debug mode is enabled.
* **Non-Interference**: The debug tool must operate in a way that does not alter the application's logic, state, or core behavior. Instrumentation should be passive, and the performance overhead should be negligible, especially in production environments where the tool is disabled.
* **Zero Dependencies & Self-Contained**: The debug tool must be self-contained within the `fir` library. It will not require developers to download or manage any external JavaScript or CSS files. All necessary assets will be embedded directly into the Go binary using the standard `embed` package, which ensures they are correctly bundled even when `fir` is used as a library dependency.

## 3. Event Transport: WebSocket with HTTP Fallback

* **Primary Transport**: The framework prioritizes WebSockets for real-time, bidirectional communication.
* **HTTP Fallback**: In scenarios where a WebSocket connection cannot be established (e.g., disabled on the controller, network restrictions, or client-side errors), `fir` automatically falls back to using standard HTTP POST requests for event handling.
* **Debugging Parity**: The debugging tools must function seamlessly across both transport mechanisms. The `Live Event Inspector` will capture and display events whether they arrive via WebSocket or HTTP POST. The `Enhanced Debug Logging` will clearly indicate the transport used for each event.

## 4. Modular Event Handling Strategy

* **Introduce an Event Registry**: To decouple event definition from routing, we will introduce a central `EventRegistry` within the controller. This registry will be the single source of truth for all events in the application.
* **Event Registration**: Each `OnEvent` handler will be registered with the `EventRegistry`, associating an event ID with its handler function and the route it belongs to. This can be done during the controller's initialization phase as it processes the `fir.Route` configurations.
* **Introspection API**: The `EventRegistry` will expose a public API for introspection. The `debug/analyzer` will use this API to get a list of all registered server-side events, rather than inspecting the internal route structures of the controller. This promotes loose coupling and reusability.

## 5. Static Mismatch Analysis

This component aims to prevent runtime errors by identifying "orphaned" events—events fired by the server that have no corresponding listener in the frontend code for a given route.

### 5.1. Implementation Steps

1.  **Create an Analyzer Package**:
    * Introduce a new package, e.g., `internal/debug`.
    * This package will contain the logic for parsing and analyzing routes.

2.  **Event Source Identification**:
    * The analyzer will query the controller's `EventRegistry` to get a comprehensive list of all registered event IDs and their associated route patterns (e.g., `/users/{id}`). This replaces the need to manually inspect the `fir.Route` slice.
    * The analyzer will build a map of potential server events for each route pattern: `map[route_pattern] -> []string{event_id_1, event_id_2, ...}`.

3.  **Client Listener Extraction**:
    * For each route pattern, the analyzer will use the controller's template engine to access the parsed templates (including partials). This avoids re-implementing template discovery and parsing logic.
    * A utility function within the `debug` package will then traverse the parsed template nodes to find all attributes representing `fir` event listeners (`x-on:fir:<...>` or `@fir:<...>`).
    * The parser will extract the `event-id` from each listener.
    * The result will be a map of listeners found in the templates: `map[route_path] -> []string{listener_event_1, listener_event_2, ...}`.

4.  **Comparison and Reporting**:
    * For each route, compare the set of events generated by the server with the set of listeners found on the client.
    * An event ID from the server is considered matched if a listener for that event ID exists in the template for any of the states (`ok`, `error`, `pending`, `done`), which are documented in the [alpinejs-plugin/README.md](alpinejs-plugin/README.md).
    * Log warnings for any server event ID that does not have a corresponding client-side listener.
    * This analysis should be integrated into the server's startup sequence when in development mode.

## 6. Advanced Debugging Capabilities

To provide a truly first-class developer experience, the debug tool will draw inspiration from mature tools like the React/Vue DevTools and the Django Debug Toolbar. This means going beyond simple event logging to provide a holistic view of the application's state and structure.

*   **State Inspector**: A panel to inspect the client-side state managed by the `fir` Alpine.js plugin (`$fir.state`). This will provide a clear, real-time view of how the UI's state changes in response to server events, making it easy to debug state-related issues.
*   **Routes Inspector**: A dedicated panel to provide a complete overview of the application's structure. It will list all registered routes, their associated templates, and the event handlers they respond to, all derived from the `EventRegistry`.
*   **Performance Profiler**: The tool will offer a detailed breakdown of server-side event processing, showing time spent in the event handler versus time spent rendering each template patch. This helps developers pinpoint performance bottlenecks with precision.
*   **Integrated Error Reporting**: A new "Errors" tab will capture and display runtime errors (e.g., panics, template execution errors) with full stack traces directly in the debug UI, preventing developers from having to switch back to the console.

## 7. The Debug UI: Architecture and Features

This component provides a real-time, interactive dashboard for inspecting the `fir` system.

### 7.1. Architecture

*   **Automatic Route Handling**: The `fir` controller, when debug mode is enabled, will automatically handle requests for a predefined path (e.g., `/fir/debug`). It will inspect incoming requests in its `ServeHTTP` method and, if the path matches, it will serve the debug UI directly. This prevents the need for developers to manually register the debug route in their application's router.
*   **Instrumentation**: The controller's request handling logic will be instrumented to capture event data (request, response, metrics) and forward it to the `debug/hub`. This instrumentation is active only when debug mode is enabled.
*   **Debug Hub & Assets**: The `internal/debug` package will contain the WebSocket hub for broadcasting data to the UI and an `http.Handler` for serving the embedded assets and handling WebSocket upgrade requests. The controller will delegate to this handler for the `/fir/debug` route.

### 7.2. UI Features

The debug UI will be a single-page application with a tabbed interface:

1.  **Events Tab**:
    *   A chronological list of all captured events.
    *   Each entry will show the event ID, transport type (WebSocket/HTTP), and key performance metrics at a glance.
    *   A detailed view for a selected event, showing:
        *   **Request Context**: URL and route parameters.
        *   **Client Event**: `fir.Event` details (ID, params, etc.).
        *   **Server Response**: A list of `dom.Event` patches, with HTML rendered in a sandboxed `<iframe>` and state/data shown as formatted JSON.

2.  **State Tab**:
    *   A live view of the JSON object representing the client-side state (`$fir.state`).
    *   The view will automatically update as the state changes.

3.  **Routes Tab**:
    *   A table listing all registered application routes.
    *   For each route, it will show the associated templates and the server-side event IDs it handles.

4.  **Performance Tab**:
    *   A detailed performance breakdown for each event, visualizing the time spent in the `OnEvent` handler versus the time spent rendering each individual template patch.

5.  **Analysis Tab**:
    *   Displays the warnings generated by the Static Mismatch Analysis. This view will be updated in real-time if file watching is implemented.

6.  **Errors Tab**:
    *   A list of runtime errors captured from the server, complete with stack traces.

## 8. Reactivity and Development Workflow

To make the tool useful during development, it needs to react to code changes.

1.  **File Watching**:
    * Use a library like `fsnotify` to watch for changes in `.go` and `.html` files.
2.  **Hot Reloading**:
    * **Template Changes**: On `.html` file changes, the server can clear its template cache and re-run the static analysis. The new warnings can be pushed to the debug UI via WebSocket.
    * **Go Code Changes**: Changes to `.go` files require a re-compilation and server restart. This is best handled by an external tool like `air` or `fresh`. The debug tool should be designed to work seamlessly with such tools, leveraging the existing "Development live reload" capability mentioned in the [README.md](README.md).

## 9. Proposed File Structure

```sh
/
├── internal/
│   ├── debug/
│   │   ├── analyzer.go      # Static analysis logic (uses EventRegistry)
│   │   ├── hub.go           # WebSocket hub for the inspector
│   │   ├── capture.go       # Functions to capture event data
│   │   ├── assets.go        # Contains `//go:embed` directives and serves assets

│       └── registry.go      # The new EventRegistry
├── controller.go            # Instrumented to call debug.Capture()
└── ...
```

## 10. Enhanced Debug Logging & Configuration
This is a parallel effort to improve the general debuggability of the core library, independent of the UI tool. It serves as the primary method for debugging when WebSockets are disabled or when a live UI is not needed.

*   **Master Debug Flag**: Introduce a new controller option, e.g., `controller.WithDebug(true)`. Enabling this option will:
    1.  Configure the global logger in `internal/logger` to output detailed, structured logs.
    2.  Enable the automatic handling of the `/fir/debug` route to serve the Debug UI.
    3.  Turn on the instrumentation required to capture and broadcast event data.
*   **Centralized, Configurable Logger**: The `internal/logger` package will be the single source of truth for all logging. It will be refactored to be configurable, supporting structured logging (e.g., using `log/slog`). All parts of the `fir` framework will use this central logger.
*   **Log Points**: Add detailed logging at critical points in the request lifecycle, with a focus on performance metrics for HTML patches:
    *   On new WebSocket connection: `INFO: websocket connected`
    *   On incoming event: `DEBUG: event received transport=[websocket|http], id=..., params=..., size=...B`
    *   Before invoking handler: `DEBUG: invoking OnEvent for id=...`
    *   On response generation: `DEBUG: sending patches count=..., target=..., size=...B, latency=...ms`
    *   On errors: `ERROR: event processing failed id=..., error=...`

This section breaks down the development of the debugging tool into a series of manageable, commit-friendly milestones. Each sub-milestone is designed to be a single, atomic commit that can be completed in 1-3 hours.

### Sub-Milestone Validation

**Important**: After each sub-milestone, ensure quality by running:

* `go build .` - Verify compilation succeeds
* `go test ./...` - Run standard test suite  
* `staticcheck ./...` - Check for lint issues
* Manual testing of affected functionality

### Full Milestone Testing

**Important**: After completing each full milestone (0.5, 1, 2, etc.), ensure comprehensive testing by running:

* `go test ./...` - Standard test suite
* `DOCKER=1 go test ./...` - Full test suite including Docker-dependent tests (Redis pubsub, etc.)

The Docker-enabled tests provide additional coverage for features like Redis-based pubsub functionality that require containerized services.

## 12. Process Improvements and Best Practices

*Based on learnings from Milestone 0.4 implementation, the following process improvements have been identified to ensure smooth execution of future milestones:*

### 12.1. Milestone Decomposition Strategy

**Break Down Large Milestones**: Large milestones should be broken down into smaller, well-defined sub-milestones of 1-3 hours each. This provides:

* Better progress tracking and review points
* Reduced risk of scope creep
* Easier rollback if issues arise
* More manageable code review units

**Example**: Instead of "0.4: Ensure `fir:` attribute parsing logic is self-contained", break it down into:

* 0.4.1: Analyze current parsing/grammar duplication
* 0.4.2: Create consolidated `internal/firattr` package
* 0.4.3: Move parser and translation logic to `firattr`
* 0.4.4: Update consumers to use new API
* 0.4.5: Clean up unused code and run static analysis

### 12.2. Implementation Planning

**Write Implementation Details Before Coding**: Before starting any milestone, write down:

* Specific files that need to be modified
* Key functions/types that need to be moved or refactored
* Potential blockers and architectural constraints
* Expected test impact and validation strategy

**Document Architectural Boundaries**: Clearly identify what can and cannot be moved/refactored and why. This prevents wasted effort and provides valuable context for future work.

### 12.3. Quality Assurance Process

**Continuous Validation**: After each major change:

* Run `go build .` to ensure compilation
* Run `go test ./...` to verify functionality
* Run static analysis tools (e.g., `staticcheck`) to catch lint issues
* Fix issues immediately rather than accumulating technical debt

**Clean Up Immediately**: Remove unused code, wrapper functions, and imports immediately after refactoring rather than leaving them for later cleanup.

### 12.4. Git and Change Management

**Atomic Commits**: Structure commits to be atomic and reviewable:

* One logical change per commit
* Use `git commit --amend` to include related cleanup in the same commit
* Write descriptive commit messages that explain both what and why

**Test-Driven Validation**: Before considering a milestone complete:

* All existing tests must pass
* Static analysis must be clean
* Build must succeed without warnings
* Any new functionality should have appropriate test coverage

### 12.5. Communication and Documentation

**Capture Learnings**: Document key insights, blockers, and architectural decisions discovered during implementation. This knowledge is valuable for:

* Future milestones in the same project
* Similar refactoring efforts in other projects
* Onboarding new team members

**Regular Check-ins**: For complex milestones, consider intermediate check-ins to validate approach and catch issues early.

### 12.6. Risk Mitigation

**Incremental Refactoring**: For large refactors, prefer incremental changes that maintain functionality at each step over big-bang rewrites.

**Validation Points**: Establish clear validation criteria for each sub-milestone to ensure quality and prevent regressions.

**Rollback Strategy**: Always maintain a clean git history that allows easy rollback to the last known good state.

### 12.7. Future Milestone Planning

These improvements should be applied to the remaining milestones (0.5 through 6) by:

1. Breaking down each milestone into smaller sub-milestones
2. Writing detailed implementation plans before starting
3. Establishing clear validation criteria for each step
4. Planning for continuous testing and cleanup

*These process improvements ensure that future milestones maintain high code quality while progressing efficiently toward the debug UI goals.*

## Milestone Completion Notes

### Milestone 0.5 - EventRegistry (COMPLETED)

**Completion Date**: December 2024  
**Duration**: Full implementation cycle  
**Files Modified**:

* Created: `internal/event/registry.go` (EventRegistry interface and implementation)
* Created: `internal/event/registry_test.go` (comprehensive unit and concurrency tests)
* Created: `event_registry_integration_test.go` (integration tests)
* Modified: `controller.go` (added EventRegistry instantiation and GetEventRegistry method)
* Modified: `route.go` (integrated event registration and lookup with registry)
* Modified: `connection.go` (updated to use registry for event execution)

**Key Achievements**:

* ✅ Thread-safe EventRegistry implementation with RWMutex protection
* ✅ Route-scoped event namespacing (events registered per route ID)
* ✅ Complete introspection API (`GetAllEvents()`, `GetRouteEvents()`) for debug tools
* ✅ Backward compatibility maintained (legacy `onEvents` map preserved with TODO)
* ✅ All existing tests pass without modification
* ✅ No performance regression - event handling optimized with better data structures
* ✅ Comprehensive test coverage (unit, integration, concurrency, edge cases)
* ✅ Clean code quality verified with staticcheck

**Technical Details**:

* EventRegistry uses `interface{}` for handler type to avoid circular imports
* Type assertion to `OnEventFunc` performed at execution time
* Registry supports efficient event lookup with `map[routeID]map[eventID]handler` structure
* Full isolation between routes - events in one route don't interfere with others
* Safe concurrent registration and execution operations

**Next Steps**: Ready to proceed to Milestone 1 (Foundational Logging & Configuration)

### Next Milestone Implementation Plan: 0.5 - EventRegistry

**Before starting Milestone 0.5, here is the detailed implementation plan:**

#### Files to Modify/Create

* **New**: `internal/event/registry.go` - Core EventRegistry implementation
* **Modify**: `controller.go` - Replace map[string]OnEventFunc with EventRegistry
* **Modify**: `route.go` - Update event registration to use EventRegistry
* **New**: `internal/event/registry_test.go` - Comprehensive tests for EventRegistry
* **Modify**: Any files that directly access controller's event map

#### Architecture Overview

```go
// EventRegistry interface for loose coupling
type EventRegistry interface {
    Register(routeID, eventID string, handler OnEventFunc) error
    Get(routeID, eventID string) (OnEventFunc, bool)
    GetRouteEvents(routeID string) map[string]OnEventFunc
    GetAllEvents() map[string]map[string]OnEventFunc  // For debug introspection
    Remove(routeID, eventID string) bool
}

// Implementation will be thread-safe with RWMutex
// Will support route-scoped event namespacing
// Will provide introspection API for debug tools
```

#### Key Functions to Implement

1. `NewEventRegistry() EventRegistry` - Constructor
2. `Register(routeID, eventID string, handler OnEventFunc) error` - Event registration
3. `Get(routeID, eventID string) (OnEventFunc, bool)` - Event lookup for execution
4. `GetAllEvents() map[string]map[string]OnEventFunc` - Debug introspection
5. Migration functions in controller.go to replace direct map access

#### Potential Blockers

* **Event ID conflicts**: Need to decide on route-scoped vs global event namespacing
* **Backward compatibility**: Ensure existing OnEvent calls continue to work
* **Thread safety**: Event registration vs execution concurrency needs careful handling
* **Memory management**: Consider event handler lifecycle and cleanup

#### Test Strategy

* Unit tests for all EventRegistry methods
* Concurrent access tests for thread safety
* Integration tests with existing route/controller functionality
* Performance benchmarks to ensure no regression

#### Expected Impact

* **Breaking changes**: None - should be transparent to existing code
* **Performance**: Minimal overhead, possibly slight improvement due to better data structure
* **Dependencies**: No new external dependencies required
* **Debug capability**: Enables introspection for static analysis and debug UI

#### Success Criteria

* All existing tests pass without modification
* EventRegistry provides all functionality of current map-based approach
* Debug tools can enumerate all registered events
* No performance regression in event handling
* Thread-safe operation under concurrent load
