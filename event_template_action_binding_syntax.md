The event template binding syntax in the provided code allows associating specific templates or actions with events triggered by the frontend. This syntax is used to define how events (like `ok`, `error`, `pending`, etc.) interact with templates or blocks of HTML. Here's an explanation of the syntax:

### General Syntax
```html
@fir:<event>:<state>::<template-name>
```

### Components of the Syntax
1. **`@fir:` or `x-on:fir:`**:
   - Prefix indicating that the attribute is related to a `fir` event binding.
   - `@fir:` is shorthand, while `x-on:fir:` is compatible with Alpine.js.

2. **`<event>`**:
   - The name of the event being handled (e.g., `create`, `delete`, `toggle-done`).

3. **`<state>`**:
   - The state of the event. Common states include:
     - `ok`: Event succeeded.
     - `error`: Event failed.
     - `pending`: Event is in progress.
     - `done`: Event is completed.
   - States can also have a `.nohtml` modifier to indicate no HTML should be rendered.

4. **`::<template-name>`** (Optional):
   - Specifies the name of the template or block to render when the event occurs.
   - If omitted, the default behavior is used.

### Examples
1. **Basic Event Binding**:
   ```html
   <div @fir:create:ok="template1">
       <!-- Render `template1` when the `create` event succeeds -->
   </div>
   ```

2. **Multiple States**:
   ```html
   <div @fir:[create:ok,delete:error]="template2">
       <!-- Render `template2` for `create:ok` or `delete:error` -->
   </div>
   ```

3. **No Template**:
   ```html
   <div @fir:create:ok>
       <!-- Handle `create:ok` without rendering a specific template -->
   </div>
   ```

4. **State with `.nohtml` Modifier**:
   ```html
   <div @fir:create:ok.nohtml>
       <!-- Handle `create:ok` without rendering any HTML -->
   </div>
   ```

### Notes
- **Modifiers**: States can include modifiers like `.prevent`, `.stop`, `.self`, etc., to control event propagation.
- **Dynamic Class Names**: The system automatically generates CSS class names like `fir-create-ok--<key>` for elements, which can be used for styling or targeting.
- **Error Handling**: Events like `error` can be used to display validation or server-side errors.

This syntax provides a declarative way to bind events to templates, making it easier to manage dynamic updates in the frontend.
