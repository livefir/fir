A Go toolkit to build reactive web interfaces.

## Why does it exist ?

Wants to provide a way to build moderately complex reactive apps for folks who are comfortable with Go.

The library is a result of a series of experiments to build reactive apps in Go: [gomodest-template](https://github.com/adnaan/gomodest-template). It works by `patching` the DOM on user events using [morphdom](https://github.com/patrick-steele-idem/morphdom).

## What is it ?

- Its a toolkit: a Go library, a CLI and an alpine.js plugin
- Focuses only on the view layer.
- Ships with an Alpinejs plugin for user interactions(click, submit, navigate ) etc.

## Who is it for ?

- Suitable for Go developers who want to build moderately complex apps, internal tools, prototypes etc.
- Skills needed: Go, HTML, CSS, Alpine.js.

## What can you do with it ?

- Build reactive webapps using Go, html/template and sprinkles of declarative javascript(alpine.js)
- Update parts of the web page on user interaction without reloading the page over regular http: clicks, form submits etc.
- Stream page updates over a persistent connection(WS, SSE): notifications, live tickers, chat messages etc.
- Use the CLI to generate html using [entgo schema](https://entgo.io/docs/schema-def)

## Is it like hotwire or is it like phoenix liveview ?

It borrows the idea of patching DOM on user interaction events from [phoenix live view](https://hex.pm/packages/phoenix_live_view). But instead of streaming DOM diffs over websocket and sticthing it back on the client, it takes the [hotwire](https://hotwired.dev/) approach of re-rendering html templates on the server and sending back a patch DOM operation to the javascript client over standard HTTP.

Live patching of the DOM(over websockets, sse) is also available but only for server driven DOM patching.(notifications, live ticker etc.)

## Principles

- **Library** and not a framework. It’s a Go **library** to build reactive user interfaces.
- **Nothing crazy tech**: It is built on nothing crazy tech: Go, html/template and Alpinejs. It’s just plain old html templates sprinkled with a bit of javascript.
- Keep Go code free of html/css: Use `html/template` to hydrate html pages.
- Keep Javascript to the minimum: Alpinejs provides declarative constructs to wire up moderately complex logic. The `fir` JS client provides additional Alpinejs functions and directives to achieve this goal.
- Have a simple lifecycle:
  - Stages: Render html page -> Handle UI change events → Update parts of the html.
- Be SEO friendly: First page render is done fully on the server side. Real-time interaction is done once the page has been rendered.
- Have a low learning curve: For a Go user the only new thing to learn would be Alpinejs. And yes: HTML & CSS
- No custom template engine: Writing our own template engine can enable in-memory html diffing and minimal change partial for the client, but it also means maintaining a new non standard template engine.

## Status

Work in progress. The current focus is to get to a developer experience which is acceptable to the community. Roadmap to v1.0.0 is still uncertain.
